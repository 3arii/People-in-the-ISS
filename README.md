# People-in-the-ISS
A GUI app to describe how many people are in the ISS right, their names and crew positions.

This app uses Tkinter and Selenium modules to mine date from the https://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/ website. With selenium the driver is opened and the first h1's and the first class name which is "person name"

It than prints that data out to the console while creating a tkinter app which has a nice full background image. It gives you the data about how many people are on space, their names and their crew missions. No matter how many people are taken from the website their names and crew positions will be given accordingly

I have tried to make it look as pleasing as I can but contributions to it's looks and it's code is more than welcome as it currently takes about 12.07 seconds to do everything I have said

Disclaimer: The data shown nor the background image in belonging to me
